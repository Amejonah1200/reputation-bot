# Welcome to Reputation Bot

The reputation bot will scan messages for thank phrases, which you can define.\
When a thank phrase is found the bot will try to find the receiver of the message. This is done by several checks.

- Answer: You can answer the message which helped you with a thank word.
- Mention: You can mention the user which helped you with a thankword
- Fuzzy: You can write the name, or a part of the name relative to a thank word, and the bot will try to find the user.

As an alternative you can also give a reputation reaction to the message which helped you.

After a user has given another user a reputation he has to wait a configurable amount of minutes until he can give this
user reputation again.\
Also if a message is older than a configurable amount no reputation will be given when someone answers it or adds a
reaction.

You can invite the bot with
this [link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=834843896579489794&scope=bot&permissions=1342532672). \
Or if you dont trust me you can host it by yourself.
